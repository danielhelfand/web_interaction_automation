# web_interaction_automation
This repository contains simple examples for automating website interactions through code, specifically Python. The examples here rely on the Python libraries [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).

The `requests` library is used for making requests to websites (e.g., logging in to a website). BeautifulSoup is used for web scraping (e.g., extracting values from HTML content).

### Dependencies

Install `requests`:
```
pip install requests
```

Install `beautifulsoup4`:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Install `webbrowser` (Used in Examples)
```
pip install webbrowser
```
